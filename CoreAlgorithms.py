#In this notebook we'll be walking through 4 fundamental machine learning algorithms.
#Tensor Flow (TF) is an incredibly large library, and it's not always necessary to memorize syntax
#The algorithms we'll look at include:
#Linear regression, classification, clustering, hidden markov models

#Linear regression is one of the most basic forms of machine learning
